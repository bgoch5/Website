<br>
Biostatistics PhD student at the University of Minnesota and recent BS Mathematics/MS Biostatistics graduate from the University of Oklahoma/University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. My research experience thus far spans health data science, mental health, math education, ornithology, and causal inference methodology. I am especially interested in using R, Python, and other open-source statistical software packages and programming languages to create insights from large and disparate data sources.
